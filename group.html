Grouped_ZProjector performs a z-projection on a stack of images.
The stack is segregated into some number of groups (by specifying
a group size) and a z-projection is performed on each group using
ZProjector.  The result is a new stack of images, one slice for
 each group. The output stack has the same type as the input stack.
The projection methods supported are the same as for ZProjector;
 currently "Average Intensity", "Max Intensity", and "Sum Slices".
 (It appears that ZProjector actually uses the "Average Intensity"
 method instead of the "Sum Slices" method.) 
 <p>

 Grouped_ZProjector is primarily designed to be run as a plugin
from within the ImageJ environment, but may also be used by other
 plugins, etc...  When launched as a plugin, the default constructor
is used and then the run method is called.  Other code wishing to
 use Grouped_ZProjector should use the setMethod and computeProjection
methods directly; the buildDialog getMethod, and validGroupSize methods
 may also come in handy.

The <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i> command in ImageJ 1.40 or later, which does "grouped" projections if 
you first convert to a hyperstack using the <i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Stack to Hyperstack</i> command.
