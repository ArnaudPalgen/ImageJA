This plugin performs granulometric filtering of digital images.
The algorithm is described in Prodanov et al. J. Neurosci. Methods 2005

Perhaps the oldest and most frequently used technique in the empirical sciences to quantify the size of solid particles is to
 use a series of sieves with increasing mesh openings. To quantify the properties of discrete sets of objects Matheron theorized
 empirical sieving into the formal concept of mathematical granulometry (Matheron, 1975). Granulometry was later
 applied in image analysis to both binary and continuous tone images (Serra, 1982). In a way similar to sieving grains, pixels
 comprising an image are "sieved" according to their connectivity to similar pixels imposed by a certain primitive geometric body
 termed Structuring Element (SE). An integral characteristic of granulometry is the
 distribution of pixels with respect to the diameters of the used SE-s. A local maximum in its normalized first derivative,
 the granulometric size density (G(d)), indicates the presence of a number of objects matching the particular SE. Moreover,
 granulometry can act as a band-pass filter capable of discriminating grains of a certain size based on their similarity to a SE.
 By exploiting this property, images can be simplified substantially to successfully isolate various
 classes of objects.

 <li><b>Type of SE:</b> can be one of circle, diamond, square, hor. line or vert. line
  <li><b>Radius of SE:</b> the radius or half/length [square, lines] of SE
  <li><b>Step:</b> the increse from the Radius - Radius2=Radius+step
 <li><b>Euclicean distance:</b> check to compute the Euclidean distance/area
