<tr valign=top><td ><b>Description:</b></td><td >
This plugin will open a new cell counter GUI.
On the left are the counter types and counters, on the right the action buttons.<br>
<br>
<b>Functions:</b><p>

<ul>
<li><b>Initialize:</b> Initializes the current image or stack for counting, this will create a duplicate image/stack titled "counter window" - when keep original is checked, the source image remains open
<li><b>Add:</b> adds a counter type.
<li><b>Remove:</b> removes the last counter type.
<li><b>Delete mode:</b> toggles between insert and delete mode. When checked, the marker of the currently selected type closest to the mouse cursor will be deleted when you click.
<li><b>Delete:</b> delete the last placed marker.
<li><b>Reset:</b> reset all counters to 0.
<li><b>Results:</b> Shows the counter results in the ImageJ results table. In case of a stack the counts per slice and the totals are displayed.
<li><b>Save Markers:</b> Exports the marker data to an XML file - Only available when running java 1.4 or higher
<li><b>Load Markers:</b> Loads stored marker data from an XML file - - Only available when running java 1.4 or higher
<li><b>Export Image:</b> Makes a copy of the counter image with the markers written on it (only the current slice is copied in case of a stack)
<li><b>Measure...:</b> Measures the pixel value at each marker and displays a result window showing: Type - Slice - X coordinate - Y coordinate - Pixel Value
</ul>

<b>Usage:</b>
<blockquote>
Open the Cell Counter plugin and the image/stack you want to count (if the Cell Counter plugin is already open you don't need to open a new instance). Click initialize, now you are ready to count features. <br>
Note that at any time you can add types or remove them.
Select the type you want to count, and count by clicking on the feature in the image. A colored number corresponding to the type you are counting will be displayed on the image every time you click, and the corresponding counter is updated.
<p>
Add the following macros to <i>ImageJ/macros/StartupMacros.txt</i>, restart ImageJ, and you will be able to change the counter type by pressing "1", "2", "3", etc.
<pre>
  macro "Type 1 [1]" {call("CellCounter.setType", "1");}
  macro "Type 2 [2]" {call("CellCounter.setType", "2");}
  macro "Type 3 [3]" {call("CellCounter.setType", "3");}
  macro "Type 4 [4]" {call("CellCounter.setType", "4");}
  macro "Type 5 [5]" {call("CellCounter.setType", "5");}
  macro "Type 6 [6]" {call("CellCounter.setType", "6");}
  macro "Type 7 [7]" {call("CellCounter.setType", "7");}
  macro "Type 8 [8]" {call("CellCounter.setType", "8");}
   
</pre>
