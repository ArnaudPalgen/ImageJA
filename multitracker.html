MultiTracker uses ImageJ's particle analyzer to track the movement of
multiple objects through a binary or thresholded stack. The object
number and coordinates may be optionally written to the image stack at
the end for verification. This filter is based on the Object Tracker
plugin filter by Wayne Rasband.
A <A HREF="images/termites.zip">test stack</A>, contributed by Ross Lang, is available.

<p>
Here is a procedure for tracking particles by hand: 
<p>
Decrease the brightness of your stack by one value. Run "Click Forward"
to on your stack (just once) and use the mark tool (with the WHITE
foreground color) to follow one point through the stack by clicking on
it repeatedly. Rewind (save a copy first) and track another point
through your stack. When you have marked as many points as you like,
save your stack, and threshold it. You will get black dots on a white
background (the colors get inverted by the threshold). 
<p>
Go to the first frame and use the magic wand tool to select a point.
Then hit "measure" to get the centroid. Repeat for the next point, etc.
When you have marked all of the points in order, select the background
(to insure that the ROI encompasses the entire image) and use the new
multitracker tool to get the coordinates for each point in the stack in
the requested order. Make sure that there are exactly as many
measurements as there are particles (i.e. 3 measurements for 3
particles). If the right number of measurements are found, the
multitracker plugin will use them for the initial positions and ordering
of the particles.
<p>
Setting the measurement order is particularly crucial if you are marking
by hand. This allows you to repeat the measurement several times (to
compensate for measurement error) and keep the marked points in the same
sorting order every time. This makes averaging and other statistical
analysis much easier.
