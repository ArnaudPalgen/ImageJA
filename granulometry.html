Granulometries were introduced by Matheron [G. Matheron, Randoms sets and
integral equation, Wiley, New York, 1978.] as tools to extract size
distribution from binary images. By performing series of morphological
openings with a family of structuring elements (SE-s) of increasing size, we
can obtain the granulometry function which maps each SE to the number of
image pixels removed during the opening operation with the corresponding
structuring element.
<p> 
The pixel size distribution function Ps can be defined as
<p>
Ps(k)= Sum of all the pixels in the image, opened with k-th SE.

One can also define the Normalized size distribution function simply as
N(k)=1- Ps(k)/Ps(0), where Ps(0) is the Ps of the original image.
<p>
The granulometric density function can be defined as
<p>
G(k)= N(k+1) -N(k)
<p>
This function can be viewed as discrete first derivative function of image
structure sizes. The above definition is often referred to as pattern
spectrum of the image. A local maximum in the pattern spectrum at a given
scale indicates the presence of many structures at that scale.
<p>
In the current algorithm implementation I use the RankFilter class provided
by ImageJ for the gray-level openings with structure element of circular
shape with specified size (hence the Maximal size of opening parameter).
