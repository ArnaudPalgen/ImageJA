This plugin allows the user to perform a zprojection on an RGB image, specifying
which algorithm (avg, power mean, max, min, sum, median, stdev) should be used for each channel 
seperately, by splitting the image into its component channels, performing the projections,
and merging to create the resulting RGB image.  The values for the median and stdev are
rounded during conversion back to 8bit.  The values for the sum method are autoscaled
as a factor of the max value of each channel to fit in a byte.  All other methods can be followed
by autoscaling to improve display as well.  Specific Power mean degrees can be specified.

The plugin operates on a previously opened stack of images, and
produces a new zprojected image.  The output image is 
generated upon completion of processing for all of the input data.  Be sure to save
the output if desired.<br><br>
The user can specify the following:<br>
<ul>
    	<li>Which method will be employed to Zproject for each channel:
	<ul>
        <li>The Average of the Intensities
        <li>The Power Mean of the Intensities
        <li>The Maximum of the Intensities
        <li>The Minumum of the Intensities
        <li>The Sum of the Intensities (scaled)
        <li>The Standard Deviation of the Intensities
        <li>The Median of the Intensities
	</ul>
	as well as<br>
	<li>Whether auto-scaling should be applied</li> 
	<li>The degree of the Power Mean</li>
</ul>
