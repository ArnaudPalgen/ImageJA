<tr valign=top><td ><b>Description:</b></td><td >
This Paintbrush tool is based on the Mouse_Listener example plugin. 
It allows painting on images or stacks. Click and drag to paint
using the current foreground color, or hold down the ALT key to paint
using the background color. The size of the paintbrush can be set with

<i>Edit/Options/Line Width...</i>
<p>
If you make a mistake, select <i>Edit/Undo</i> to remove the last painted
stroke.
<p>
The plugin acts as a toggle switch for painting or selecting. Run
the plugin once to attach the paintbrush to the foreground window and
begin painting. Run it a second time on the same window to detach the
paintbrush and allow selection. The paintbrush may be toggled on a
per-window basis.
<p>
The plugin works by removing any other mouse listeners from an image
canvas and setting itself up as the only mouse listener. If it finds a
paintbrush already attached to a canvas, that paintbrush is removed and
the old mouse listeners are restored.
