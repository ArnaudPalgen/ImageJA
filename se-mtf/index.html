The ImageJ plugin SE_MTF  (short for Slanted Edge Modulation Transfer Function) has been developed by Carles  Mitja, Jaume Escofet, Aura Tacho and Raquel Revuelta at the Image Quality  Laboratory (LQI, short for Laboratori de Qualitat de la Imatge) in the Center  of the Image and the Multimedia Technology (CITM, short for Centre de la Imatge  I la Tecnologia Multimedia) from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC,  Spain).<br />
<br />
The plugin performs system MTF calculations up to twice the Nyquist frequency over  slanted vertical edge images with dark side at left; if the picture is taken from  a horizontal slanted edge, the image must be rotated 90 degrees before running  the plugin.<br />
At the same time, the plugin  run the calculations and shows as a result four plots labeled with the SPP_,  ESF_, LSF_ and MTF_ prefixes respectively followed by the file name. ESF, LSF  and MTF plots are calculated and traced as described in the MTF bibliography.  SPP plot (short for Sampling Periodicity Plot) is a plot showing the result to  apply the Fourier Transform Function to the series of the maximum values of the  LSF used in the MTF calculations; the plot is a valuable indicator of  periodicity sampling reliableness<strong> </strong>performed  by the system because of the slanted position of the edge related with the  sensor grid. In general, cheap cameras or scanners show a confused SPP with no  clearly isolated peaks; conversely, a well calculated file from a professional  camera or high end scanner shows a clearly isolated peak related with the  number of pixel rows that is occupied by the period of sampling. <br />
The four plots generated by  the plugin takes the size and proportions from the previously selected options  by the user in the Edit&gt;Options&gt;Profile plot options menu in ImageJ. The  represented units are indicated in each plot and the user can take advantage of  the three buttons below the plots in order to list, save or copy the plot  values and export it as is usual in ImageJ. Finally, the plot images can be  saved as TIFF for further use. <br />
The edge can occupy the whole  image (Fig., 1) or only a part of it, so the user can select a ROI to be  analyzed (Fig., 2). The method used to calculate the MTF from a slanted edge is  fully described in the bibliography (see references at the bottom of the page). <br />

<br />
As usual in ImageJ, the file SE_MTF_2xNyquist.jar must be copied to the plugin folder or  subfolder; after restart ImageJ, the SE_MTF label must appear in the Plugins  menu. On play, it will open the SE_MTF frame with the button Generate MTF, as it  is shown in the Fig., 3. <br />

It is necessary to have an opened image prior to activate the Generate MTF  button; otherwise ImageJ shows an Error frame with the message: There are no  images open. Process cancelled; after pressing it, ImageJ can show one of the  following messages: <br />
<br />
o Warning, &ldquo;All image selected&rdquo; if there is  no ROI selected in the active image window. The user can press the OK button  and the plugin will use all image rows to calculate the MTF. If a ROI is  selected, the message will not appear and the MTF is calculated from the pixels  of selected rows. <br />
o Error, &quot;Line or  rectangular selection required. Process canceled&quot;. <br />
o MTF Options. This last frame  takes different aspect related with the image bit depth and the units of the  plots.<br />
First of all, user can choose  between three kind of units with whom the plots are going to be shown: Absolute  (lp/mm), Relative (cycles/pixel) or Line With Per Picture Height (LW/PH).<br />
