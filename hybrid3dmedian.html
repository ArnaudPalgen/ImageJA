 This plugin consists of a 3D adaptation of the Hybrid Median Filter intended for XYZ or XYT data,
 which we are calling a 3d Hybrid Median Filter. In this implementation, the median
 is calculated from the medians of 1) the 3x3 2d PLUS kernel, 2) the 3x3 2d X kernel,
 3) the 3x3 3d PLUS kernel, and four 3x3 2d X kernels through the center pixel along
 Z-axis: 4) the vertical X, 5) the horizontal X, 6) the X from the upper right to the
 lower left, and 7) the X from the upper left to the lower right, and optionally 
 8) the pixel in question.  The 3D median model is experimental, intended for series 
 (time or finely-spaced z slices) where high noise places little confidence on individual 
 pixel values per image. The pixel in question receives less weighing in medians (included 
 in 7 medians calculations) versus checked (7 median ranks plus median of the 7 AND the 
 pixel). Checking the box retains single pixel data more (see frame numbers or 1-pixel 
 scratches), and performs less data "restoration". Since the filter samples local 
 3x3x3 volumes, data stacks should be oversampled. The top and bottom edge pixels 
 are reflected outward, and the side edge pixels are wrapped arpund to complete the edge bound kernels.   
 The pixels of the first and last slice are reflected outward to simulate data for the N-1
 and N+1 slices (where N is the number of images in the stack) in order to return an output
 stack which is the same size as the input stack. The filter may be aborted by hitting the escape key.

See <A HREF="hybrid2dmedian.html">2d Hybrid Median Filter</A> for a version which works on single images
and slices of a stack independent of one another.

The plugin operates on a previously opened stack of images, and
produces a new stack of filtered images.  The output stack is 
generated upon completion of processing for all of the input data.  Be sure to save
the output if desired.<br><br>

<p>Figure 1) 3d Hybrid Median Filter Demo<br>
The lefthand frame represents the original data, the middle is filtered data excluding the 
pixel in question in the final median (unchecked option), and the righthand side is the filtered data
including the pixel in question (checked option).  Playback on key frames is slowed to allow
appreciation of intended effects and event description.
