<p>This plugin draws iterated growth models in ImageJ.   
  These are saveable screen drawings made of points calculated using the
  basic expressions: <BR>
  <B>x<sub>n+1</sub> = mx<sub>n</sub><sup>Xxpow</sup>
  + ny<sub>n</sub><sup>Xypow</sup> + o</B> <BR>and<BR>
  <B>y<sub>n+1</sub> = fx<sub>n</sub><sup>Yxpow</sup> +
  gy<sub>n</sub><sup>Yypow</sup> + h</B>.
  <p>
  For each model, 
  each equation's coefficients (m,n,o;f,g,h; Xxpow, Xypow, Yxpow, Yypow) are
  specified in sets that the user can modify.
  Each of these sets also contains a probability of using the
  set.  This is for cases when more than one set of coefficients
  is used to calculate each point, chosen according to a likelihood
  that the user sets.  </p>
 <p>Each particle calculated and drawn is coloured on a black background, and all 
  are the same size.  Colours are generated randomly, without user input.
  The user can change the size of the particles
  in the models, however, using an option in the first popup.

</p 

<h3>Models</h3>
  <p>There are five default models. The user
  can change the coefficients to vary the basic pattern, or 
  change the number of sets to create a new model.
  <ul><li> The
  "Henon" model is specified by one set of coefficients (i.e., 
   the likelihood of using that set is 1).  </li>
  <li>The Henon Map model is also specified by one set of 
  coefficients.  It has a (capacity) fractal dimension that is
  assumed to be around 1.261 (correlation dimension around 1.25).</li>
  <li>The "Random" model is similar to the Henon models, but uses
  two sets of coefficients and probabilities.
  </li><li>The "D. Greene Fern" model uses four sets
  of coefficients.  It is from an algorithm by
  David Greene (Charles Sturt University),
  </li><li> The custom model is
  essentially the same as the fern, with a few changes in coefficients and probabilities.
  </li></ul>
<h3>Using the plugin</h3>
  <ol><li>To generate a default model, the user selects a model from
  the dropdown menu on the first popup.  The number
  of sets for the selected model is automatically determined,
  and this number will appear in the next popup.  
  <li>If the user
  wants to modify a model, the number in this second popup can be changed.
  <li>  After
  a number of sets is selected, one popup appears for each set.
  The popups show each coefficient's
  name listed beside a textbox for its
  value.  The values can be left at the defaults,
  or changed as desired.
  <li>At the bottom of each of these popups, there is a space for
  the probability that the coefficients above it
  will be used in generating each next point.  The total of
  all probabilities should not be greater than 1; all sets for values
  that make the cumulative total greater than 1 are ignored.
  </ol>
