   This plugin consists of 3 versions of the standard hybrid median filter: a 3x3, 
   5x5, and 7x7 kernel. In these implementations, the median of 1) the median of the NxN PLUS
   kernel, 2) the median of the NxN X kernel, and 3) the pixel in question replaces
   the original pixel value.  Multiple repetitions can automatically be run by specifying a repeat 
   value greater than 1.  The top and bottom edge pixels are reflected outward, and the side
   edge pixels are wrapped around to complete the edge bound kernels.  This plugin works both 
   with stacks and individual slices.
<br><br>
See <A HREF="hybrid3dmedian.html">3d Hybrid Median Filter</A> for another version which works on
stacks of data using a three dimensional kernel.
