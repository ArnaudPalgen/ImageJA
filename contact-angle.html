This plug-in calculates the contact angle of a drop on a flat surface using
the sphere approximation (theta=2atan(2h/l) and the ellipse approximation.
This code has been written by Marco Brugnara and it¡¯s based on the plug-in
"Pointpicker".
<p>
The necessity to have a self-developed software comes by considering that
commercial softwares do not provide a sufficient enough description of the
methods used in their contact angle calculation. In fact people often
perform contact angle measurements, by applying the sphere approximation,
neglecting in this way the gravity effect, or by calculating the tangent of
the profile without limit the drop volume. In our experience, confirmed by
the Literature as well, the maximum volume, whose profile as a sphere shape,
is about 3-5 microlitres; it depends on the contact angle as well. For
bigger drops the other possible approaches are 2: to use some "correction
factors", present in Literature, or to apply another model called ADSA,
which in fact calculates the angle applying on the profile the Laplace
equation. This last model works really well on profiles strongly modified by
the gravity, instead it has some trouble by solving the equation if the drop
has an almost spherical profile. It is important to underline that in many
commercial packages coming with the devices, it is often present another
approach called in general "tangent line" which calculates the tangent of a
fitting curve of the drop profile near the triphase line. This approach is a
least debatable, if the best-fit function is polynomial equation, chosen
only for its low chi square, but without any physical meaning. Then way to
analyze images can furnish precise results, which are however meaningless if
the drop volume is too large: in fact the contact angle is not the
geometrical angle if this last one is modified by other forces than surface
tension. In fact if the shape depends significantly on the gravity force,
the resulting angle is not a value of contact angle as defined in Theory,
but just an angle depending on the gravity. It is a pity that who develops
these programs, most of the times does not know the Literature.
<p>
In our plug-in the image analysis works offline; it means that an image
database is required. After a picture is loaded, the drop profile is
detected.
It is important to remind that the program was written supposing the drop is
upside down. The reason is that our images are obtained by a camera
connected to a microscope and the final picture is reversed up/down.
<p>
A manual detection of the base line is required, by choosing the FIRST 2
points. For this reason the plug-in could fail if the triphase line is not a
straight line.
<p>
In the PlugIn Preferences menu the user finds the option "boundary
conditions" where one can include or exclude one or both of these points in
the drop profile.
<p>
Other 3 points are then requested along the drop profile in order to
identify a ROI.
<p>
In order to calculate to contact angle, four different options are possible:

<ul>
<li> a Manual points selection
<li> a measurement by using a circle best-fit
<li> a measurement by using an ellipse best-fit
<li> an analysis by applying both bestfits
</ul>

When the manual points selection is chosen, the user need to detect the
profile manually placing some points along the drop edge. The circle and the
ellipse passing trough the points are reckoned.
<p>
The best-fit analysis automatically detects the drop profile; for this
reason a very well defined picture is required. The user has the possibility
to modify the threshold in order to exclude the main part of the background.
After these points are automatically collected a best fit procedure of a
circle or an ellipse or both can be applied.
<p>
It is important to point out that an ellipse best-fit analysis poses itself
between the circle best fit (which has a physical meaning) and an absolute
best-bit function. Some times can happen that the drop is not perfectly
symmetric, or that there is a slight effect of the gravity. In this case an
almost-circle analysis can provide useful results.
<p>

Our plug-in is completely open source and in a constant developing and there
are still many things to improve. For instance many error controls are not
implemented yet, so if points are chosen in the wrong sequence, the user
just obtains meaningless results.
