This plugin draws diffusion limited aggregate 
(fractal growth) models in single or multiple steps,
as shown below. The plugin has 9 options:

<ol>
<li>Number of Particles:</li> The user types in
 a number for the number of particles that are 
allowed to attach to the model. The default is 2000.
Future releases will include an option to specify the number
of points dropped or the number of points allowed to 
attach.

<li>Particle Size:</li> 
Specifies the size in pixels of each particle that is 
allowed to "diffuse" and stick to the model. The default 
is 1, and is always corrected to be no less than 1.
Currently, particles are always centred on the point to
 which they stick; future releases will give the option 
to stick to the edge of a particle.

<li>Image Size: </li>The user can set a desired image size,
but if this is too small for the number of particles
selected, the image size is adjusted to accomodate them all. 

<li>Particle Shape: </li>The particle shape can be set to 
round, triangular, or square. 

<li>Square DLA: </li>Particles are released from either 
a square or a round outer boundary, as selected by the user. 

<li>Fill Particles: </li> Particles are outlined
if this option is left unselected, or filled if it is selected.

<li>Watch Model Grow: </li> The user can select this option to
see growth on the screen, or unselect it to wait until all
of the points are calculated.  To stop growth, press escape.

<li>Binary Image: </li> The image can be generated using random
 colours or black and white.

<li>Stacks: </li> The user can choose to make stacks or one final image.  
Typing 1 or less for this option generates
 single images, and greater than 1 generates stacks that can be 
scrolled through to see incremental
 growth.  Final images or stacks of diffusion limited 
growth can be analyzed
 for the fractal dimension (see 
<A HREF="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/frac-lac.html">
 FracLac</A> for ImageJ; these are best generated as binary).
In addition, diffusion limited growth as a process 
can be viewed by
 writing the stack to an avi </A>
(<A HREF="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/avi.html">see
 the avi writer plugin</A>, for instance).
