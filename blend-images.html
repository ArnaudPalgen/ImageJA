This sample ImageJ plugin filter blends an image with another one,
i.e., it adds another image with user-specified weight.
 <p>  
A few things to note:
<ol>
    <li> Filter plugins must implement the PlugInFilter interface.
    <li> User plugins do not use the package statement;
    <li> Plugins residing in the "plugins" folder, and with at
       least one underscore in their name, are automatically
       installed in the PlugIns menu.
    <li> Plugins can be installed in other menus by 
       packaging them as JAR files.
    <li> The class name ("Blend_Images") and file name 
       ("Blend_Images.java") must be the same.
    <li> An ImagePlus is, roughly speaking, an image or stack that has a name
       and usually its own window. An ImageProcessor (ip) carries image data
       for a single image (grayscale or color), e.g. the image displayed in
       the window of an ImagePlus, or a single slice of a stack. Depending
       on the image type, an ImageProcesor can be a ByteProcessor (8 bit),
       ShortProcessor (16 bit), FloatProcessor (32 bit) or ColorProcessor (RGB).
    <li> This filter works with selections, including non-rectangular
       selections. It is the programmer's responsibility to modify only
       the pixels within the ip.getRoi() rectangle; with the flag
       SUPPORTS_MASKING ImageJ takes care of out-of-roi pixels in that
       rectangle (for non-rectangular rois).
    <li> The run method of a PlugInFilter will be called repeatedly to
       process all the slices in a stack if requested by the user.
    <li> It supports Undo for single images. ImageJ takes care of this.
   <li> This filter uses the following methods of the ImageProcessor class:
       ip.toFloat(i, fp), ip.setPixels(i, fp) and ip.getNChannels(),
       simplifying code that does float operations on grayscale images of
       any type or on the channels of color images. See the run(ip) method.
       These methods were added in ImageJ 1.38n.
</ol>
