This is a contrast-enhancing ImageJ plugin for 8 bit
greyscale images.  It creates a new contrast-enhanced image from the processed image.
It asks for the geometric half length (halfLength) of the 
contrast-enhancing square. More information is available at
<a href="http://www.artenum.com/en/produits/libre/ijce/ijce.html">
http://www.artenum.com/en/produits/libre/ijce/ijce.html</a>.
  <p>
  The contrast-enhancing algorithm was proposed by 
Didier Pelat (Paris Observatory 
<a href="http://www.obspm.fr/">http://www.obspm.fr/</a>)
and implemented by Artenum 
(<a href="http://www.artenum.com/">http://www.artenum.com/</a>).
  <p>
Filter_Rank version 1.1.0 based on Contrast_Enhancer_ version 1.0.3
<p>
 Modified by G. Landini G.Landini@bham.ac.uk on 23/Nov/2003:
<ul>
	<li>Changed "half-length" for "filter window size" (more intuitive)
	<li>Added option to do (or rather "not to do") rank randomisation, so please be
        aware of this change in the algorithm
	<li>Added option for (not to) rescale to 8 bit range (to keep the real rank value)
	<li>Added option to overwrite the image data (no new image is created)
	<li>Added capability to filter stacks and to be recordable (for macro creation)
	<li>Moved dialog to setup()
	<li>Added "About..."
</ul>
<p>
Pending issues / bugs:
When a stack is processed and "Create new image" is checked,
it creates individual images rather than a new stack.
As a temporary measure do run("Convert Images to Stack"); to merge result into a stack.
