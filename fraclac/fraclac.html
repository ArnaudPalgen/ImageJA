Charles Sturt University with input from Dr. H. Jelinek
and code from Thomas R. Roy, University of Alberta, and continues to develop in response to the many suggestions from users.

<tr valign="top"><td><b>Description:</b></td><td>
Some patterns - such as contours of biological cells, other biological
structures, fractals, and some textures - are difficult to describe
using Euclidean measures like diameter or length, but can be
quantitatively assessed using measures of complexity. FracLac
quantitates such difficult to describe details of morphology
represented in binary or grayscale digital images, using mass and box
counting fractal dimensions (D<sub>B</sub>s), multifractal analysis data, lacunarity (&#955;) data, and some other morphometrics. 
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><b>Features:</b></td><td>

<p>
FracLac scans images using a shifting grid algorithm that can do
multiple scans from different locations on each image, and uses either
a nonoverlapping or an overlapping sliding box method. The overlapping
method can be exhaustive or not, depending on user choices. FracLac
automatically generates different types of series of box sizes (e.g.,
power or linear). In addiiton, local dimension scans may be done on
subareas of either images or rois to show local variation in the D<sub>B</sub>
and &#955;. These subareas are determined according to the user's choice,
using ImageJ's ParticleAnalyzer, a square grid sized according to the
user's choice, randomly selected blocks, or individual pixels. Users
can view or save the results, and can reapply LUT's to colour coded
images or generated text images (explained below).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><b>Use:</b></td><td>
Before images can be analyzed, FracLac has to be set up. This is
usually simply a matter of clicking a button for the type of scan you
want to do, then selecting the defaults in the relevant options panel
that appears, or making modifications if required. <p>Once
FracLac has been set up, the type of scan appears at the bottom of the
FracLac panel, and buttons to perform scans are enabled, as shown on
the screen shot below. Using FracLac, one can do fractal, multifractal,
and lacunarity analyses on:
</p><ol><li>entire open images,</li><li>rois,</li><li>stacks, and</li><li>multiple files selected from directories.</li></ol>  
<table><tbody><tr><td><!--img src="shot.jpg"--></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><b>Outputs:</b></td><td>
The information returned by the various types of scans is summarized below:
<ol><li>Standard Box Count<ul><li>D<sub>B</sub>s for binary images, based on multiple origins for each image or roi, including a minimum cover D<sub>B</sub>, slope-corrected D<sub>B</sub>, and average D<sub>B</sub> all based on the count of boxes containing pixels at different box sizes and grid locations</li>
<li>Mass dimensions for each image or roi for binary and grayscale
images using the difference in either the density or intensity of
pixels in boxes of different sizes placed over an image.</li> 
</ul></li>
<li>Subareas Scan
<ul><li>Local fractal dimensions.  These are based on
<ol><li>subareas (e.g., systematically or randomly chosen blocks or else particles) or </li>
<li>pixels and their surrounding environments, which can be set to be round or square</li></ol></li></ul></li>
<li>Local Connected Fractal Dimensions.
<ul><li>These are based on the round or square environment surrounding each
 pixel but limited to the connected set around that pixel. 

<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="cs.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table>
The screen shot shown here illustrates the panel that comes up when the
button for a "Local Connected Fractal Dimension" scan is clicked. The
panel as shown is set up to use a circular sampling element by
selecting the box marked "Use round scan areas". The panel also shows
where the user can select to save generated files or view them on the
screen (the option is presented when each type of scan is set up). </li>
<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="panel.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></ul>
</li><li>Multifractal spectra.
<ul><li>For multifractal scans, FracLac returns an array of D<sub>Q</sub> values over a range of arbitrary values for Q set by the user.</li>
<li>It also provides &#964;, &#945;, and the multifractal function &#402;(&#945;). </li></ul>
</li><li>Lacunarity data
<ul><li>FracLac returns measures of &#955; based on data gathered during
<ul><li>overlapping scans (sliding box lacunarity) or
</li><li>nonoverlapping (regular box counting)</li></ul></li></ul>
</li><li>Other morphometrics, including measures of density, span ratio, circularity, and the convex hull.  
</li></ol>

<h3>Data Files</h3><p>The measures noted above are reported in data
files accompanied by various statistics for the data, including the
y-intercept, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation, for
instance. Reports generated can be viewed and saved as Results Windows
or automatically saved as .xls files (tab-delimited). These include:
</p><li>summary reports
</li><li>data files
</li><li>raw pixel counts
<p></p>
<h3>Graphics Files</h3><p>Some measures are represented in graphics that can be viewed and saved or automatically saved.  These include:
</p></li><li>colour coded images for local dimensions, as illustrated in the image below
<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="coded.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table>
</li><li>text images for colour coded images
</li><li>convex hull and bounding circle images
</li><li>graphs (e.g., multifractal spectra, as shown below, and regression statistics)
<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="mf.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>Limitations:</b></td><td>FracLac works on
binary images (black pixels on a white background, or white pixels on a
black background) and grayscale images. For a binary analysis (e.g., of
cellular outlines), images must be thresholded prior to analysis to
ensure that only the pixels of interest are assessed. For grayscale
scans, images and rois are padded with a value that is ignored by the
counting method. <p>
