 This Plugin was developed for X-ray PhotoElectric Emission Microscopy (X-PEEM). 
 It takes a stack of images and allows the user to choose a region of interest 
 and then extract the spectrum in a new window. The user can then select theon-peak 
 and off-peak regions in the spectrum plot window. Clicking on the division 
 map button with take the on-peak images and divide it by the off-peak image 
 and display the resulting ratio image in a new window. This gives the user 
 an idea to an element's concentration within a sample. The user can also 
 select multiple regions of interest and display them in a seperate window 
 by clicking the copy ROI button. The spectrum's can then be extracted and 
 saved in a text file that can be read by excel by clicking the ROI Spectrum 
 button. This version also allows you to read in the energies from a file. 
 This is useful if the images are not equally spaced apart in energy. 
 Finally the Reset Energies button allows the user to reset the starting 
 energy of the stack as well as the energy step size.
