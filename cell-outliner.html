Won't work on single images - a work around is to simply add an empty
frame into the image. </td></tr>

Download <A HREF="download/Cell_Outliner.java">Cell_Outliner.java</A>
to the plugins folder, or subfolder, and compile and run 
using <i>Plugins/Compile and Run</i>. Restarting ImageJ will add a "Cell Outliner"
command to the Plugins menu or a submenu of the Plugins menu.

Applies the magic wand to a picture with a specified threshold and at a
specified point on a stack. Will process an entire stack with specified
starting frame and ending frame, using the magic wand outline to clear
inside, than clear outside and then draw a line with graylevel=255. The
"Preprocess Image" will apply a median filter with radius 1 and apply
any cuts defined by "Beginning Slice" and "Ending Slice." The plugin
provides a nifty set of navigation buttons for scanning through the
stack. It also provides a very nice little feature that has the program
to compare the size of the current outline with the previous outline and
to jog the "Vertical Centroid" value in order to find the full outline
again. This is helpful when dealing with noisy data where the magic wans
will occasionally find the outline around a patch of above threshold
noise instead of finding the desired object.

<tr valign=top><td ><b>Bugs:</b></td><td >
Sometimes draws the graylevel at a number less than 255, probably has to
do with scale on conversion.
