Excel_Writer: 
    Excel_Writer is a IJ PlugIn that saves the IJ ResultsTable directly to a user-specified 
    Excel file. The plugin will create the Excel file in the specified location and 
    add the data to a new worksheet. In case that the excel file already exists, 
    a new worksheet will be added to the existing file - data is never overwritten. 
    The plugin can also handle other tables instead of the ResultsTable. 
    You need to modify the source of Excelwriter to do this (look in SaveToExcel.java 
    for more info). This plugin is recordable and also contains methods that allow 
    automatization and batch processing via other plugins (look in SaveToExcel.java for
    more info). 

Excel_Writer_GUI:
    Excel_Writer_GUI is a graphical interface to Excel_Writer.
    Upon execution, a toolbar and menu will appear which contains the following functions:

    menuFileNew, Creates a new ExcelFile
    menuFileOpen, Opens an existing ExcelFile
    menuFileSave, Saves the current ExcelFile
    menuFileClose, Closes the current ExcelFile
    menuFileExit, Exits the plugin
    menuSheetAdd, Adds a new worksheet to the workbook
    menuSheetDel, Deletes a worksheet
    menuSheetRename, Renames a worksheet
    menuSheetSelect, Selects a worksheet for writin
    menuWriteRT, Writes the ResultsTable
    menuWriteRow, Writes the last row of the ResultsTable
    menuWriteColumn, Writes a column of the ResultsTable
    menuWriteHeads, Writes the columnheaders of the ResultsTable
    menuWriteClip, Writes the contents of the ClipBoard
    menuDeleteLastRow, Deletes the last row written
    menuDeleteCol, Deletes a column

    In addition, when a file is open, a viewer window will show the contents of the ExcelFile.
    
    This function relies on classes written by @author Andrew C. Oliver and @author Jason Height 
    as a user contribution to the Apache Jakarta POI project. Those classes and source
    can be found in the HSSFViewer directory and are protected by 

    The Apache Software License, Version 1.1.

    This version of Excel_Writer_GUI still has some bugs...


Save_XY_Coordinates_To_Excel:

    This Plugin saves the XY Coordinates of a ROI to an excelfile
    It is identical to the XYWriter in IJ, but saves to excel instead of to a text file, 
    and it processes all slices in a stack.
