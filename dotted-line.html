Choose the color bydouble clicking on the color picker tool and selectingthe desired color. The line width box sets the widthof the line. The dash pattern box takes the list ofnumbers and turns them into dashes or spaces. Thefirst number is the pixel length of the first dash andthe second number is the pixel length of the space.<p><img SRC="images/dotted-line-dialog.jpg" ALT="Dotted LineTool.jpg"><p>The example below shows some of the variations thatcan be made to the dashed lines. The red dashes showexamples of dashed lines with all the tools. The bluedashes are examples of the various line width optionsand the green dashes illustrate how the dash patternworks. The numbers next to the blue and green dashesare the values that were used to draw those dashes.  <p><img SRC="images/dotted-lines.jpg" ALT="Dotted LineDemo.jpg"><p></td></tr><tr valign=top><td ><b>Notes:</b></td><td >When making dashed lines, ImageJ converts the image toan RGB image. So if a dotted line is drawn on an 8-bitimage, the image turns into an RGB image. With theundo command, both, the dashed line and the RGB colorwill be undone. However, once more than a single linehas been drawn, the undo command will undo only thelast line that was drawn but the image will remain inRGB.</table></blockquote><p><b>|<a href="index.html">Plugins</a> | <ahref="../index.html">Home</a> |</b></body></html>
