2010/09/30 (v1.1): &nbsp;SLO image&nbsp;now has&nbsp;overlay annotating
position of B-scan lines. Fixed bug with NaN values in segmentation
layers and total retinal thickness.<br>
2010/10/04 (v1.2): &nbsp;Fixed bug with TRT in 3D files.
&nbsp;Open_Heyex_Raw now includes Log window with exam information.
&nbsp;Results table now includes B-Scan quality in dB. &nbsp;Greatly
improved speed throughout. &nbsp;Added Open_Heyex_Results and
Open_Heyex_Info. <br>

        <td>These plugins
interpret raw binary
files exported from Heidelberg Spectralis Viewing Software.
&nbsp;They successfully import both 8-bit SLO and 32-bit SD-OCT
images, retaining pixel scale (optical and SD-OCT), segmentation data,
and B-scan position relative to the SLO image (will be included in
v1.1).&nbsp; In addition to
single B-scan SD-OCT images, the plug-in also opens multiple B-scan
SD-OCT images as a stack, enabling 3-D reconstruction, analysis, and
modeling.&nbsp; The plug-in is compatible with Spectralis Viewing
Module exporting raw data in HSF-OCT-101 format.&nbsp; Scan
patterns of single line, volume in ART mode, and fast volume, were all
successfully tested. <br>
        <br>
Currently, five plugins are included. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open_Heyex_Raw</span>
plugin will open both the cSLO and OCT B-scan as separate images.
The cSLO image includes green overlay lines indicating the position of
the B-scans. Values of layers segmented by Spectralis are also be
listed in a
results table. The y position, in pixels from top of image, is listed
underneath a column
labeled with the appropriate layer. The A-scan and B-scan coordinates
are also listed. Total retinal thickness (TRT) is the calcuated
vertical difference between the ILM and RPE&nbsp;layers and is listed
in&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>&micro;m.
The scan quality for each B-scan, in dB, is also listed. B-scans are
opened
in
32-bit and
a&nbsp;1:1 pixel ratio. &nbsp;Scale information is retained and
quickly
attainable by accessing the image properties.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open_Heyex_OCT</span> opens
only&nbsp;the OCT image in a 1:1 pixel ratio.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open_Heyex_SLO</span> opens
just the cSLO image without B-scan lines.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open_Heyex_Results</span>
produces the results table only.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open_Heyex_Info</span> creates
a log window containing the exam information. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

Proper&nbsp;lateral (optical) scale&nbsp;depends upon corneal curvature
values entered in the patient exam information prior to raw export.
&nbsp;The Heidelberg Spectralis has a default corneal curvature value
suitable for a human eye. &nbsp;When working with small animals, such
as mice, the optical properties of the eye are significantly different
and require adjustment of the corneal curvature value. &nbsp;In our
paper (see citation) we adjusted corneal curvature values until the
lateral measurements matched those of histologic sections. &nbsp;Others
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19838301">Fischer et al.,
2009</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661229">Huber
et al., 2009</a>)
have injected&nbsp;micron-sized beads and adjusted corneal curvature
until they were spherical in measure. &nbsp;To ensure proper lateral
scale, corneal curvature values must be changed accordingly before
exporting the raw file.<br>
        <br>
Adjusting the image to a 1:1 &micro;m
ratio can easily be done by stretching
the A-scan data axially (Y scale) or by shrinking the A-scan data
laterally (X scale). &nbsp;Stretching will introduce interpolation
artifacts
such as aliasing, blurring and edge halos. &nbsp;Shrinking,
however,&nbsp;will
eliminate data points and depending on the resolution difference
between&nbsp;the dimensions, this may result in an unacceptably
small
image. &nbsp;For 20&deg; x 15&deg; 3D OCT scans of mouse
retina, we&nbsp;stretch A-scan data in the axial direction using
bicubic interpolation.<br>
        <br>
To Stretch, scale the image as:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">X
Scale: 1.0<br>
Y Scale: Pixel Height &divide; Pixel Width<br>
        </div>
        <br>
To Shrink, scale the image as:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">X
Scale: Pixel Width &divide; Pixel Height<br>
Y Scale: 1.0<br>
        </div>
