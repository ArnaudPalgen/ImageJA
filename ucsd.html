<tr valign=top><td ><b>Description:</b></td><td >
This is a set of 10 plugins from the <a href="http://www-cajal.ucsd.edu">University of California at San Diego</a> that are designed to support microscopy work. The individual plugins are described below.
<p>
A <A HREF="images/fluoview.tif">sample image</A> from a
12 bit confocal microscope is available. It is a single plate with
three channels. Each channel is a separate 16 bit image, with a separate 8 bit LUT for display on the
screen.

<ol>
<li> Open the "FV Control" plugin.
<li> Select "Open Fluoview Image" on the FV controller.
<li> Select the sample image (fluoview.tif ).
<li> Play with the FV control to turn various Active channels on and off.
<li> Play with the ROV adjuster which is called from the FV control.
<li> Use the "ExtendedInfo" plugin to read the original information on
collection parameters, as well as to show the various details of the 8
bit LUT used for the display of each channel.
<li> Use the Split FV on the FV Control. Notice that each individual slice
retains the original 8 bit LUT
<li> Call the "SynchWindows" plugin. Select the original image and all the
derived slices. Click on Synchronize all.
<li> When you move a cursor on one image, it will move to the
corresponding location on all of the of selected images.
<li> You can directly convert the original file to RGB 24 bit. However,
in the original format you could change the gray scale image with the
ROV control without altering the image of of any other channel. After
converting to RGB you will find that there is no way that you can
independently modify the gray scales, as it is now represented in the
R,G and B channels.
</ol>

<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">Split Stack</font></h3>
<p>Splits an image stack into a user specified number of substacks. Each substack 
  can consist of a single image.</p>

<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">SyncWindows<p>
<img src="images/syncWindows.jpg" width="676" height="319" align="top"></font></h3>
<p>Synchronize mouse motion and input between multiple windows. Thus, an ROI drawn 
  in one window is replicated in all other synchronized windows in the synchronized 
  window set. A synchronization cursor (the red box above) indicates the location 
  of the mouse in all synchronized windows.</p>

<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">Extended Info</font></h3>
<h3><img src="images/extendedInfo.jpg" width="720" height="316"></h3>
<p>Similar to ImageJ's standard Image Info plugin filter, but adds displays additional 
  information regarding lookup tables. This plugin is most useful for the Extended 
  Tiff plugin (see below) but will work for standard ImageJ image objects as well. 
  In this case, this plugin simply displays a lookup table if available. </p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">Extended Tiff</font></h3>
<p>Extends ImagePlus class to read additional information from TIFF image files. 
  Currently, this reads TIFF ImageDescription field. ExtendedTiff class also provides 
  a post processing method intended to allow its subclasses to add additional 
  processing to handle nonstandard TIFF images or standard TIFF images in an application 
  specific fashion.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">Extended Tiff Encoder</font></h3>
<p><font color="#000000">A modified version of standard ImageJ TiffEncoder that 
  also reads the TIFF image description field.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">Save Extended Tiff</font></h3>
<p><font color="#000000">A plugin that writes an ExtendedTiff file to disk.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">Clamped Color Model</font></h3>
<p><font color="#000000">This class provides an indexed color model that also 
  supports upper and lower bounds on the indices. This allows the indices to be 
  &quot;clamped&quot; to these bounds prior to their use to retrieve color lookup 
  table data.</font> This class is used in the FluoviewTiff plugin, described 
  below, and will probably not be of interest to general uses. However, it must 
  be present to run the FluoviewTiff and related plugins.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">Fluoview Tiff</font></h3>
<h3><img src="images/fv1.jpg" width="488" height="417"></h3>
<p>Extends ExtendedTiff class to manage additional information associated with 
  Fluoview Tiff images. This information consists of color table data, intensity 
  mapping parameters and a collection of acquisition parameters. Thus, we can 
  display images, such as that shown above, wherein three (grayscale) channels 
  are colored using the associated color table information and combined into one 
  24-bit color display. </p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">FV Color Display</font></h3>
<p>Toggles color display mode on/off. </p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">FV Control</font></h3>
<p>This plugin collects a variety of operations that are specific to manipulation 
  of Fluoview images. For instance, users can toggle specific channels on and 
  off. This plugin also provides an integrated interface to Fluoview specific 
  versions of some of the above standard plugins, e.g. Z-projection and stack 
  splitting. </p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#224488">FV Split Stack</font></h3>
<p>A version of the Split Stack plugin that is specifically designed to handle 
  Fluoview images. The Fluoview split stack plugin splits a Fluoview stack into 
  multiple substacks, one for each channel in the original data set. In addition, 
  the Fluoview split stack plugin ensures that appropriate Fluoview channel information 
  is propagated to each of the new stacks.</p>
