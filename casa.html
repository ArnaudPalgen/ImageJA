        </span></b><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA)
outperforms manual techniques, many investigators rely on non-automated
analysis due to the high cost of commercial options. In this study, we have
written and validated a free CASA software primarily for analysis of fish
sperm. This software is a plugin for the free National Institutes of Health
software ImageJ and is available with documentation at </span><a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/casa.html"><span style="">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/casa.html</span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
        </span>That it is open source makes possible external validation, should
improve quality control and enhance the comparative value of data obtained
among laboratories. In addition, we have improved upon the traditional velocity
straight line (VSL) algorithm, eliminating inaccurate characterization of highly
curved fish sperm paths. Using this system, the motion of zebrafish (<i style="">Danio rerio) </i>sperm was characterized relative
to time post-activation and the impact of acquisition conditions upon data
analysis determined. There were decreases in velocity and path straightness
(STR), but not linearity (LIN), relative to time. From 30 to 300 frames/sec,
frame rate significantly affected curvilinear velocity (VCL) and STR
measurements. Sperm density in the field of view did not affect any measured
parameter. There was significant inter-male variation for VCL, VSL, velocity
average path (VAP), percent motility, path character (STR, LIN), and duration
of motility. Furthermore, relative sperm output (a measure reflecting both
semen volume and concentration) was positively correlated to percent motility. For
all motion parameters measured (except duration), the average CV was <u>&lt;</u>
10 %, comparable to values obtained using commercial systems.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
